# Knowledge Transfer Engine

Sometimes, as your processes and procedures grow, the documents that contain them become too unwieldly.  Your employees start avoiding the procedure, because they don't have time to read it.  That's not good.  Unread procedures can be performed incorrectly.  Unread procedures can become outdated.  Unread procedures can cause your employees to lose confidence in your entire library of training documents.

The solution is to make your procedure dynamic, simple, and fast--a container of knowledge.  That's where this tool will come in.

## Beyond multiple choice

Current decision tree software focuses on providing ways for you to express a "choose your own adventure" path through a process, but this is not enough:
* You need to remember your employees answers
* You need to re-use or loop certain steps
* You have crazy-complicated logic 
* You want reporting
* You want your tools to link together

KT Engine solves these issues by modeling your process flow as a __graph of questions and answers__ and the __dependencies__ that each one provides and consumes.
